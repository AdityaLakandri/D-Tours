        <h1>Sikkim</h1>
        <p>
            Sikkim is an Indian state and located in the north-eastern part of the country. The hill town Gangtok  is its capital. Sikkim has international borders on three sides... its north border is with Tibet (which is now part of China), western border with Nepal and the eastern border is with Bhutan. Only the southern border is with India and that is with Darjeeling district of the state of West Bengal.<br/>
            <br/>
            Almost the whole of Sikkim is in a hilly terrain surrounded by the Himalayan mountain range. The altitude across Sikkim varies widely and ranges from the lowest elevation of 280m (920ft) to the highest point of Kanchenjunga peak which lies at the border of Sikkim and Nepal and at an altitude of 8,586m (28,169ft). Altitude of the capital Gangtok is 5,410ft.<br/>
            <br/>Sikkim was an independent dynasty of Namgyal kingdom from the 1642 until 1975 when it eventually joined India and became its 22nd state. During the Namgyal monarchy it has been invaded by the bordering countries Nepal and Bhutan several times when it succumbed to these external forces, but regained its control through strange turn of events.

            <h1>Weather & Best Time to Visit Sikkim</h1>
            <p>Sikkim's cool and pleasant climate attracted the British during the colonial days who made it a health resort (a sanatorium) for themselves as early as 1829. Although there was a stiff resistance from the Khasis for such foreign occupation of the land, but they could not stand against the mighty power of the British and finally paving way for development of a great health sanatorium for the British similar to that of Darjeeling.<br/><br/>
                Winter typically starts from December and ends in February. Itâ€™s usually quite cold and dry during winter. March to May is a great time to visit Sikkim, the temperature is pleasantly cool around this time. June onwards the monsoon starts and can rain incessantly. Monsoon lasts till August and even beyond. October to November is again a great time to visit Sikkim.</p>
