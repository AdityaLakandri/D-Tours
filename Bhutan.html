        <h1>Bhutan</h1>
        <p>
            Bhutan shares its borders with Tibet (on north &amp;&nbsp;east) and India (bordering west, south and partly east). It's located on the southeast slope of Himalayas with an average altitude of about 2,400m. Thimphu is the capital and Paro is the only place having a commercial airport.<br/>
            Bhutan follows constitutional Monarchy. The house of Wangchhuks have ruled the country since 1907. Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck (the thunder Dragon King) has been the monarch since December 2006 and his son Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck (born 5 February 2016) is slated to be the next King.<br/>
            However, tourism is not obtrusively promoted in Bhutan and I had the impression that tourists are organically drawn to the country despite the whopping 250 USD per day that is charged from all foreigners (barring Indians and Bangladeshis).

            <h1>Gangtey(Phobjika)Valley</h1>
            <p>For the naturalist and the seeker, Gangtey Valley is nothing short of Paradise. There is a vast expanse of wide space where black necked cranes flock to as they migrate from the north. Phobjika village, Nakay Chu river (black water river), Gay Chu (white water river), Gangtey Goempa and Black Crane Information Centre are some of the main attractions off Gangtey. You could club your Gangtey visit with Wangduephodrang as they are a two-hour drive apart.</p>

            <h1>Mongar and Lungthse</h1>
            <p>If you visit Bumthang then you can journey to the serene Mongar valley through the Thrumshing La Pass. Roaring waterfalls, rocky cliffs and unusual color schemes of vegetation makes this one of the best places in East Bhutan. Yakang Lhakhang and Drametse Lhakhang are the main sightseeing spots in Mongar while many choose to drive to Lhuntse (75 km away) which has a savage rocky beauty and offers Bhutan’s finest rural weaves.</p>
