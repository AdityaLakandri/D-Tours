        <h1>Mirik</h1>
        <p>
            If you are planning a vacation in Darjeeling area, it can be a great idea to spend a couple of days in Mirik and then make an onward journey to Darjeeling or other places. You can also do the reverse. In fact Mirik lies almost halfway between Siliguri/NJP and Darjeeling on the alternative route that goes to Darjeeling through scenic tea estates. Mirik is a small hill town and part of Kurseong subdivision and within Darjeeling district.

            <h1>Mirik Lake</h1>
            <p>The greatest reason to visit Mirik is its scenic views with the central attraction being the 1.25kms long lovely lake (known as Sumendu Lake) surrounded by Dhupi trees on it western bank and a vast park land with flowering plantations on the eastern bank. Mirik is a tranquil laid back hill station. There are vantage points from where you can get lovely sights of Kanchenjunga snow peaks. And of course the area is surrounded by many rolling tea estates on mountain slopes.</p>

            <h1>Weather & Best Time to Visit Mirik</h1>
            <p>The climate generally remains pleasantly cool with temperature varying between a maximum of 30°C in summer to a minimum of 2°C during peak winter. A unique and an amazing phenomena in Mirik is cloud entering through the windows and you getting engulfed in it, and it happens quite often.<br/>
                The best time to visit Mirik is between Mid March to End May, and Mid September to December. From April onwards the summer starts and the temperature warms up. You won't need any woolens during the day time in summer. However the evenings are pleasantly cool and a light sweater is goof enough.<br/>
                June onwards the monsoon begins and usually lasts till September. From mid-September onwards the climate again starts becoming great for tourism. October is the real rush period. Woolens are usually not required during the day time till October end. From November onwards it starts getting cold and you will need to wear woolens even during the day time. By December the peak winter sets in. So during summer carry light woolens and during winter heavy woolens.
