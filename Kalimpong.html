        <h1>Kalimpong</h1>
        <p>Kalimpong was earlier a subdivision of Darjeeling district, but now a separate district of West Bengal effective 14th Feb 2017 with an area of 1,056 square kilometers and inhabiting 49,403 people (as per 2011 census). Kalimpong town itself is small, located about 2.5 hours drive from both Darjeeling and Siliguri. But the town and its surrounding areas offer immense opportunities for tourism.<br/><br/>
            . So the name Kalimpong actually means Stronghold of King's Minister and has originated from the time of king's dynasty in the region. Some say that the name has been derived from the word Kalibong (locals call it Kaulim). It's a type of fiber plant used for making paper. This plant is found in abundance in Kalimpong.<br/>
            <br/>Kalimpong is located at an altitude of 4,100ft. Because of its relatively lower altitude compared to Darjeeling or Gangtok, the weather is milder and pleasant for most part of the year. And therefore it suits all tourists who are looking for such pleasant weather combined with magnificent views of Kanchenjunga and other Himalayan snow peaks, sweeping landscapes and lush greenery.
            In 1866 Kalimpong was made a part of Darjeeling district. When the British had taken over Kalimpong, many Nepalese migrated to Kalimpong in search of livelihood. Lepchas, the original inhabitants of the place also flourished. Many Indians from the lower plains settled here for business. And slowly Kalimpong became a hub of trading center with Tibet. Mules &amp;&nbsp;caravans would wend down from the Tibet plateau and trade wool here in exchange of manufactured goods. However the trade with Tibet ceased to operate in mid 1960s when Tibet was taken over by China.
