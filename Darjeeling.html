        <h1>Darjeeling</h1>
        <p>Darjeeling is a resort town in the Himalayas that attracts over 4.5 lakhs tourists annually. Other than its picturesque settings in the hills and wonderful climate, Darjeeling is known for its top class aromatic tea for which it is adored worldwide, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway which is fondly known as the Toy Train which is now part of UNESCO World Heritage Site.
         But Darjeeling has lot more attractions to offer other than sprawling tea gardens on slopes of the hills and its heritage toy trains. And that includes scenic parks &amp;&nbsp;gardens, a zoo with high altitude Himalayan animals, world renowned mountaineering institute with its vast museum showcasing exhibits from many historic expeditions, lovely view points, waterfalls, monasteries, museums etc.
         If you are planning to visit some of them on foot, remember a couple of things. First a distance in the hills will feel like almost three times of a similar distance in the plains as you walk uphill. And most of the roads in Darjeeling have steep gradients. Second, there are some sightseeing places in Darjeeling that can only be reached on foot. A vehicle can only go up to a point beyond which you will need to walk. So in general, a sightseeing day in Darjeeling should start early.

            <h1>Darjeeling Zoo</h1>
            <p>Known as Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, the main entrance to Zoo and HMI are the same and both should be covered at the same time. The unique feature of this zoo is, it houses animals of high altitude and mostly from upper Himalayas. You can see some rare animals here like Red Pandas, Snow Leopards, Tibetan Wolf and lot more. In 2018 the Bengal Natural History Museum has been moved to the compound of HMI and Zoo. It started as a modest effort in 1903 to display butterflies and birds of Darjeeling district, but had eventually grown to house a large collections of mammals, birds,nests with eggs, reptiles fishes and even insects of wide varieties. The displays are actually specimens of real creatures that had been captured, stuffed and preserved.</p>

            <h1>Kids & Families</h1>
            <p>If you are travelling to Darjeeling on a vacation with your family and kids, you will need to keep in mind the interest of your children. There are places that kids &amp;&nbsp;children would love to visit and things they would love to do. For example horseback riding with a guide at Mall (Chowrasta) is very popular, children love to ride the Ropeway (cable car) and of course the famous steam engine toy trains, and the Zoo here has many fascinating high altitude Himalayan animals which are seldom seen else where.</p>
