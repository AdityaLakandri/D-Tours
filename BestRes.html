              <h1>Keventer's</h1>
              <h4>(English Breakfast & Snacks</h4>
              <p>For us, a Darjeeling vacation is nevr complete without a breakfast at the Keventer's.If you like to go for traditional English breakfast with items like great 
                  sandwiches, chicken salami & meat loafs, or pork sausages with eggs followed bya a pot of perfect Darjeelingtea ,this isthe place to go.
                  Located right at the beginning of Nehru Road that leads towards the mall, this strange looking narrow building has two floor. The ground flooris a bakery. Climb up the stairs to enter the small cozy indoor area or just walk across to come
                out the open terrace that has Kachenjunga and other lovely views around. </p>

                  <h1>Park Restaurant</h1>
                  <h4>Thai Cuisine & Others</h4>
                  <p>Park is also one of our old time favourites. Located on Laden la Road and opposite to the State Bank of India building,this restaurant offers 
                      great Thai cuisine.As the owner Deep says, once you have Thai dishes , you won't like to have Chinese items as they would taste bland. However
                      the restaurant does offer a far wider range of menus including North Indian and Chinese Dishes.
